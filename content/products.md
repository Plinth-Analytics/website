**RWD Pressure Testing**

RWD is messy. It is complicated. No one RWD dataset can be suitable for all possible use-cases. 

As a consumer of RWD, how can you know which RWD dataset is best suited to your use-case? We believe the best way to do this is through expert and data driven pressure testing. 

Proper pressure testing enables you to evaluate data for its quality and use-case suitability, speeding your time to insights, and reducing the risk of failures.

**RWD Analysis Ready Data (ARD)**

Intentionaly curated, analysis ready data derived from raw data. Unlike raw data,
analysis ready data contain only the patients and data relevant to *your* analysis
 and ready for immediate use in any analytics tool.

**RWD Analytics**

Fit-for-purpose data analytics, comprised of summary and statistical analyses, both in tables and
and visualizations.
