All of our products are built according to 3 rigorous principles:

**Business use-case driven**

Our products begin and end with a business use-case. We need to know what pain 
points your business is facing and how a product could help solve it.

**Built for humans**

Our products are built to be used, and re-used by humans. This means we would 
rather create a product that is easy to use but specific in focus, than one that 
is hard to use but broad in focus.

**Scientifically rigorous**
