> Plinth Mission Statement

Life science companies have access to an unprecedented amount of real-world health care data (RWD). This data source has the potential to revolutionize life science research and drug development. However, life science companies often struggle to quickly and robustly generate use-case specific business insights from their portfolio of RWD. This data-to-insight gap represents an underserved opportunity that Plinth will solve.
