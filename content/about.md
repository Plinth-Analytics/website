title: About Plinth
---

Plinth was co-founded by Kieran Mace, PhD and Nathaniel Phillips, PhD – two scientific leaders at the intersection of Pharma, RWD generation, and Data Science, who have dedicated their careers to realizing RWD’s potential to deliver value to the life sciences.

With leadership experience developing RWD products from medical records, and leveraging that RWD in the pharmaceutical industry, we created Plinth to empower life science teams to efficiently and robustly translate RWD into business value.
